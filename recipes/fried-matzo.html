    <h3>A classic staple that's simple but satiating, Fried Matzo is a scrambled agg and matzo based dish.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sheets of matzo</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of milk or water</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Add eggs to a bowl and scramble with a whisk along with 1 tbsp milk or water until the eggs are nice and fluffy.</p></li>
            <li><p>Run a sheet of matzo under running hot water for 20-60 seconds until it just begins to soften. The amount of time you'll need to keep it under the water depends on the type of matzo you're using. Let it get soft, but don&#39;t let it turn mushy! Shake off the excess water and reserve the matzo.</p></li>
            <li><p>Melt a tablespoon of butter in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat.<p></li>
            <li><p>Break the matzo into small pieces and place them in the skillet. Sauté the matzo pieces over medium heat for about a minute, until they are evenly coated with butter.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour the scrambled egg mixture over the matzo pieces. Stir the eggs with a spatula until they are well combined with the matzo. Cook the eggs for about 2 minutes over medium, flipping and stirring continuously—don&#39;t let the eggs sit, or they will overcook. You want the eggs to be cooked soft- not runny, but just barely cooked. Overcooked or browned eggs ruin the flavor entirely. As you are cooking, sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste. </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve immediately.</p></li>
        </ol>
