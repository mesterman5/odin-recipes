    <h3>A Philly favorite made simple.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour, plus some more for kneading</li>
            <li>1 cup of plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of coarse salt, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring 6 cups of water to a low boil in a large pot. Add baking soda.</p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mix 1 cup flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a surface dusted with more self-rising flour, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Continue adding flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.</p></li>
            <li><p>BCut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each segment into a long, thin rope, 22 to 24 inches in length. Twist the rope into a pretzel shape by taking the two ends, twisting them around each other, then securing both ends side-by-side onto the center portion of the rope.</p></li>
            <li><p>One by one, carefully drop each pretzel into the water and boil until the pretzel floats to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and increase the oven's temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush the pretzels with some of the melted butter; continue to bake until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes more. Brush with remaining butter and top with coarse salt.</p></li>
        </ol>
